## Status Meanings

- `primary` - exactly one supported version; default target for new ingests, traces, and answers.
- `active` - kept close to the primary through active-version verification.
- `legacy` - preserved for reference and questions, but not checked by default.
- `archived` - removed from active maintenance and kept under `wiki/_archive/`.

## Source Pin Rules

- Source checkouts must live under `raw/postgres-NN/`.
- Version landing pages must live under `wiki/vNN/index.md`.
